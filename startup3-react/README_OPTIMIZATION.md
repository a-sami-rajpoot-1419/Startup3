# Startup3 React (Optimized Build Summary)

This document captures the optimization & verification status of the migrated Startup3 landing site.

## Stack
- React 19 + Vite 5
- Global CSS (refactored legacy + responsive utility layer)
- ESLint + Stylelint + Custom CSS audit

## Key Improvements
| Area | Before (legacy static) | After (current) |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| CSS size (source) | ~76 KB | 52.17 KB |
| Duplicate selector entries | 103 | 75 |
| Build CSS bundle (hashed) | n/a | ~34.75 KB (gzip ~7 KB) |
| JS main bundle | n/a | ~206 KB (gzip ~63 KB) |
| Responsive strategy | Many fixed media blocks | Fluid grids + clamp() + consolidated breakpoints |
| Accessibility | Minimal | Focus-visible, reduced motion, semantic sections |
| Image handling | Large originals | (Pending) potential compression step |

## Tooling
Scripts:
- `npm run dev` – local dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:css` – code & style linting
- `npm run audit:css` – size + duplicate selector report
- `npm run verify` – lint + css audit (invoke other scripts manually for full build)

Custom audit (`scripts/css-audit.cjs`):
- Reports file size & duplicate selector occurrences.
- Current thresholds acceptable (no blocking errors).

## Responsive & Layout
- Mobile-first with a single consolidated `@media (max-width:991px)` block and minimal others.
- Grids use `repeat(auto-fit,minmax(...))` where possible.
- Typography scales via `clamp()`.

## Remaining Opportunities
1. Image optimization (largest payload contributor). Consider:
   - Converting large JPGs to optimized WebP/AVIF.
   - Generating responsive `srcset` variants.
2. Further duplicate trimming (down to <70) by merging repeated utility-like selectors (`.hero .btn-primary`, `.cta-buttons`, etc.) if desired.
3. Add Lighthouse CI / basic performance budget script.
4. Optional visual regression tests (Playwright) per section.

## Verification Status (as of last run)
- ESLint: Pass (no errors).
- Stylelint: Pass.
- CSS Audit: Size 52.17 KB; duplicate entries 75.
- Build: Succeeds; hashed JS bundle ≈206 KB.

## How to Run Locally
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build
```
npm run build
```
Output in `dist/`.

## CSS Audit On Demand
```
npm run audit:css
```

## Notes
- A stray brace causing a PostCSS error was fixed during consolidation.
- Legacy absolute positioning for testimonials & portfolio replaced with fluid grids.
- Hero typography now fully clamp-driven; redundant overrides removed.

## Next Step Suggestion
Optimize images before final deployment (widest ROI for load performance).
